# Fix for Local Download Issue

## Problem Identified
From your logs, I can see that:
1. Your scan completed successfully with 193 vulnerabilities (104 ZAP + 89 comprehensive)
2. The scan ran on https://tsit.mjunction.in/tauc/security/getLogin 
3. But the download isn't working

## Root Cause
The issue is that when you run `main.py` directly on your local machine:
- It uses SQLite database (`sqlite:///zap_scanner.db`)
- But the scan might not be saving properly to the database
- The scan_id isn't being preserved correctly for download

## Solution Steps for Your Local Environment

### Step 1: Check Current Database Records
Visit this URL in your browser: `http://localhost:8080/debug_scan_records`
This will show you all scans in your local database.

### Step 2: Fix the Database Connection (Local)
Add this to your local `main.py` or create a `local_config.py`:

```python
import os
os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'sqlite:///instance/zap_scanner.db'
```

### Step 3: Create the Instance Directory
```bash
mkdir -p instance
```

### Step 4: Test the Download Directly
If you have a scan with ID (check debug_scan_records first), test:
`http://localhost:8080/download_report/[SCAN_ID]`

### Step 5: Alternative - Use Latest Scan API
If the scan completed but download isn't working, try:
`http://localhost:8080/api/latest_scan_id`

Then use that ID for:
`http://localhost:8080/download_report/[ID_FROM_API]`

## Debug Commands for Your Local Environment

1. **Check scan records**: `http://localhost:8080/debug_scan_records`
2. **Check latest scan**: `http://localhost:8080/api/latest_scan_id`
3. **Test download**: `http://localhost:8080/debug_download`
4. **Direct download**: `http://localhost:8080/download_report/1` (if scan ID is 1)

## JavaScript Console Debug
Open browser dev tools (F12) and check:
1. Click Download button
2. Look for console messages starting with "Download report button clicked"
3. Check if any errors appear in the Network tab

## Expected Fix
After implementing these changes, your download should work correctly. The key is ensuring the scan is saved to the database with proper scan_id tracking.
