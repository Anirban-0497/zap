# PDF Download Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue Analysis

Based on the debug information, your scan completed successfully with 94 vulnerabilities, but the download fails because:

1. **Scan Status**: Shows `scan_id: null` after completion
2. **Database**: Contains scan ID 31 with results
3. **Download URL**: Should be `/download_report/31`

## Quick Fix for Local Machine

### Option 1: Direct Download URL
Open your browser and go directly to:
```
http://localhost:5000/download_report/31
```
This should immediately download the PDF report.

### Option 2: Debug the JavaScript
1. Open browser console (F12 â†’ Console)
2. Click the download button
3. Look for these specific log messages:
   - "Download report button clicked"
   - "Scan status response received: 200"
   - "Latest scan ID response: 200"
   - "Downloading report for latest scan ID: 31"

### Option 3: Check API Endpoints
Test these URLs directly in your browser:
- `http://localhost:5000/api/scan_status` - Should show current status
- `http://localhost:5000/api/latest_scan_id` - Should return scan ID 31
- `http://localhost:5000/debug_download` - Shows complete debug info

## Expected Behavior
The enhanced JavaScript should automatically fall back to the latest scan (ID 31) when the current scan status doesn't have a scan_id. If this isn't working, there may be a JavaScript error in your browser console.

## Next Steps
1. Try the direct download URL first
2. If that works, the issue is in the JavaScript
3. If that doesn't work, there may be a path or permission issue
