# Windows Setup Guide

## Quick Start for Windows

Your ZAP Security Scanner now includes a Windows-specific runner that handles database path issues automatically.

### Option 1: Use Windows Runner (Recommended)
```bash
python run_windows.py
```

### Option 2: Use PostgreSQL (Advanced)
If you prefer PostgreSQL, run your local PostgreSQL server and use:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Option 3: Simple Runner
```bash
python simple_run.py
```

## Troubleshooting Windows Issues

**Database Permission Errors:**
- Run Command Prompt as Administrator
- Make sure antivirus isn't blocking file creation
- Try running from your user directory (C:\Users\YourName\)

**ZAP Connection:**
- Make sure ZAP is running on port 8080 (as shown in your screenshot)
- Use API key: `72cnks1ojc5359jc7e4g0pt650`

**Expected Output:**
```
